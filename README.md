# Imagination-Server
A non-LUNI based server for LEGO Universe, that will almost definitely die.

## More Info
Unlike other servers, this server is not only not based off LUNI, it runs on managed code (C#). This will be using Redis for both the NoSQL/keystore database, as well as its Pub/Sub features, for server to server communication. (NOTE: This project was originally written in C++, and the outdated/broken version of the C++ code can be found in the C++ folder.)
